## PryishJS

Aims to provide a debugging interface similar to Ruby's Pry (Pry-ish) for NodeJS.

This project is similar to the existing [pry.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pryjs) (but with less features). I came up with this alternative because pry.js didn't work as expected when I tried it.

### How to use

`npm install pryishjs --save-dev`
`npm install readline-sync --save-dev`. You need to install this as a separate dependency, because the "breakpoint" actually evals a function string that tries to import readline-sync.

Code:

``` javascript
pry = require('pryish')

var a = 10

eval(pry)

a = 20
```

From the CLI: `node my-script.js`. A REPL prompt should appear.

You can try it by running `node test.js` from this project's root directory.

#### Commands

- `c`: continue with the script.
- `_c`: show calling context.
